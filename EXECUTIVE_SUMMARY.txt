ORTOKOMPANION QUESTIONS.TS - QUALITY ANALYSIS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=====================================================================

ANALYSIS SCOPE: Research-only. NO EDITS MADE.
- Analyzed: /workspaces/Ortokompanion/data/questions.ts (527 questions)
- Validated: /tmp/new_tumor_questions.txt (31 new tumor questions)
- Generated: Comprehensive quality report with improvement plan

=====================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
=====================================================================

1. MISSING TUTORMODE: 108 questions (20.5%)
   Severity: HIGH | Fix Effort: VERY HIGH
   Impact: Students cannot access progressive hints, teaching points, mnemonics
   Questions: trauma-005-020, hoeft-006-019, rygg-005-020, hand-005-050, 
              axel-005-020+, fot-005-019, sport-005-020
   
   BOTTLENECK: Requires domain expert specialists to create content

2. COMPETENCY TYPO: 52 questions
   Error: 'medisinsk-kunskap' should be 'medicinsk-kunskap'
   Severity: MEDIUM | Fix Effort: LOW (30 min with search/replace)
   Impact: Potential system validation errors, data inconsistency
   Domains: axel (13), hand (20), rygg (17), sport (2)

3. CLINICAL TERM TYPO: 1 question (sport-038)
